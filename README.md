# Soccer Recruitment System
### Identifying Undervalued Talent Through Machine Learning

## Overview

This project builds a data-driven soccer recruitment system that uses machine learning to
identify **undervalued players** whose on-field performance suggests they are worth
more than their current market value.

The system performs three main tasks:

1. **Player Market Value Prediction** — predict a player's market value from performance stats,
   age, position, league, and playing time (supervised regression).
2. **Undervalued Talent Identification** — compare each player's predicted value to their actual
   market value and rank the biggest positive gaps as potential bargains.
3. **Player Similarity Analysis** — group statistically similar players (K-Means + PCA) to find
   cheaper alternatives to a target or departing player.


## Data

The dataset combines two public sources for the 2025-26 season (top-5 European leagues):

| Source | Role | Provides |
|--------|------|----------|
| **FBref** (via Kaggle) | Features | Player performance stats: goals, assists, shots, minutes, tackles, interceptions, goalkeeping, etc. |
| **Transfermarkt** (via Kaggle) | Target + context | Market values, transfers, position, club, contract, height |

**Final dataset:** `soccer_recruitment_dataset.csv` — 2,839 players (2,514 with a market value), 71 columns.

The two sources were joined on a normalized player name + birth year (they share no common ID),
achieving an 88.6% match rate.

## Machine Learning
Predict player market value.
Trains and compares three regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) with:
  - 5-fold cross-validation
  - hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV) for Random Forest and XGBoost
  - an actual vs predicted plot
  - the trained best model saved to disk for reuse



## Machine Learning

Predict player market value. Trains and compares three regression models (Linear Regression,
Random Forest, XGBoost) with:

- 5-fold cross-validation
- hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV) for Random Forest and XGBoost
- an actual vs predicted plot
- the trained best model saved to disk for reuse
- Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Feature Importance

**Results (test set):**

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|-------|-----|------|-----|
| Linear Regression | €5.56M | €10.87M | 0.692 |
| Random Forest (tuned) | €5.28M | €10.32M | 0.702 |
| **XGBoost (tuned, best)** | **€4.96M** | **€9.84M** | **0.750** |

**XGBoost** performed best, explaining about **75% of the variation** in player market value.
Cross-validation was stable across folds (XGBoost R² = 0.757 ± 0.012), and the model relies on football-sensible drivers.
